\subsection{Previous Results}

As mentioned previously, this project is a continuation of a project done over the previous year in
which we developed a method to use pulsar timing data to constrain our models. The final results of
that project were a set of models that accurately reproduce all observables and fully incorporated
the pulsar data. Figure \ref{fig:nobin_obs_panel} shows the model fits to most of the observables
while Figure \ref{fig:nobin_mass_fun} shows the fit to the stellar mass function data. In both
cases, the models satisfyingly reproduce all observables. The median and $1\sigma$ intervals of the
best fit parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:parameters_nobin}.

One of the most interesting results of the previous project was the models' ability to constrain the
black hole content within 47\,Tuc. Figure \ref{fig:prev_nobin_BH_dists} shows the distribution of
mass in black hole mass and number of black holes in our set of best fit models, which come out to
$240^{+245}_{-146} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $41^{+27}_{-22}$ respectively. Both the total mass and
number are quite well contained especially in comparison to the previous constraints in the
literature \citep[see e.g.][]{Henault-Brunet2020,Weatherford2019}.

\subsection{Low Binary Fraction}
\ps{Describe the results for the low binary fraction model.}


In the models with a $2\%$ binary fraction, we find a similar ability to reproduce all the
observables, Figure \ref{fig:low_bin_model_obs_panel} and Figure \ref{fig:low_bin_model_mass_fun}
show the model fits compared to the data. Once again the models satisfyingly reproduce all
observables.

The black hole content in these models is also quite well contained, though different from the
models without binaries. Figure \ref{fig:low_bin_model_BH_dists} shows the distribution of mass in
black holes and number of black holes \ps{Which no longer Gaussian, instead use 95, 99 percentile
	limit? Why is this so different from $0\%$ case? This makes me want to rerun the fits for no
	binaries with all the updated data and any other changes.}


$114^{+79}_{-144} \mathrm{M}_\odot$

\subsection{High Binary Fraction}

As is the case for the models with a low binary fraction, the models with a $10\%$ binary
fraction fit the observables very well. Figures \ref{fig:highbin_obs_panel} and
\ref{fig:highbin_mass_fun} show the model fits compared to the data.

In each set of models, all observables are very well reproduced, showing the flexibility of the
\code{LIMEPY} models. Due to this flexibility, it is unlikely that with current observations we
would be able to infer anything about the binary population of a cluster using this technique.
Instead, this method should be used in cases where there are existing estimates of the binary
population within a cluster in order to add a realistic binary component to \code{LIMEPY} models



\subsection{The effects of the binaries}


Table \ref{tab:parameters_all} shows the recovered parameters for each set of models, we can see a
clear agreement in the recovered values which affect the overall structure of the cluster. In
particular, the total cluster mass, half-mass radius, anisotropy radius, truncation parameter,
degree of mass segregation and distance are all either identical or within $1\sigma$ of each other
for all three sets of models.

\ps{I'm thinking this might be even more pronounced after we rerun the no binary case, in which case
	we should highlight which parameters stay mostly the same, and which change.}


The most striking change in model parameters are the values pertaining to the mass function, in
particular, the $\alpha_3$ parameter which controls the slope of the high-mass mass function. In the
case with a $10\%$ binary fraction, this parameter is much larger than in the other two cases
showing that the abundance of binary stars reduce the need for high mass stars and remnants.

We can see that there is still some need for BHs in some of the models as the $BH_{ret}$ parameter
is much larger in the model with many binaries, this means that even though the initial mass
function produces many fewer black holes, more of these black holes are getting retained throughout
the evolution of the cluster. \ps{Don't really want this to come off as if we're saying this has
	huge physical significance, just that some BHs are required and this is how the models get them even
	with the steeper mass function.}

Table \ref{tab:BH_contents} and Figure \ref{fig:BH_KDEs} shows the distribution of BHs for each set
of models. We can see a clear decrease in the black hole content as we add more binaries. This
effect was also found by \citet{Mann2019} (see also associated erratum \citealt{Mann2020}) when they
modelled the central kinematics of 47\,Tuc.

\ps{Explain this effect, more central binaries contribute to central velocity dispersion, no need
	for so many heavy remnants}

When we examine the density profiles for the models with a binary fraction of $10\%$ (see Figure
\ref{fig:highbin_model_densities}), we can see that the binary stars are indeed more centrally
concentrated than typical main-sequence stars as predicted and in the central regions, actually
contribute more to mass density than single stars \ps{Is this true? The MS profile includes the
	binaries too (I think), why is it lower?}, while they contribute more than the neutron stars at all
radii.

\subsection{Conclusion}

\ps{Implications for past/future work}

If you believe the $2\%$ estimate for 47 Tuc, all is well. If you think it's higher, you should
consider binaries

\ps{Do binaries in df models actually matter?}


For clusters where we expect lots of binaries, maybe 3201, they should probably be considered, if
your goal is to infer remnant populations. For clusters where we don't expect binaries, probably
doesn't matter too much.








\subsection{Future Work}

We're only looking at binaries in main sequence stars. WD binaries are probably a bigger effect, but
we have no data at all to constrain those quantities, so we ignore them. Maybe looking at N-body or
MC models could give some useful constraints.

Would be nice to look at a cluster where we know there is a larger binary population (NGC3201)and
fit with and without binaries to see what the effects are.
