# Literature Review Planning

I'll probably have two overall sections, one discussing observations work and one discussing
modelling work. For each paper have the author, title and short summary or important points.

- ### Author+YEAR - Title

    Brief summary / why I want to mention it

## Observations

- ### Ji+2015 - Binary Frequencies in a Sample of Globular Clusters. II. Sample Analysis and Comparison To Models

    Looks for binaries in Hubble data for clusters in Harris catalogue. Gives estimate on $fb$ for
    $q>0.5$ and for some way of estimating the smaller $q$ values too. Also gives a minimum observed
    value for $q$ which is nice. Further, gives results just within half-light radius and within the
    core. Looks at the radial distribution of binaries in clusters, this is something it might be
    nice to look at in our models.

- ### Fisher+2005 - What a local sample of spectroscopic binaries can tell us about the field binary population

    Looks at binaries (mostly spectroscopic I think) in the solar neighbourhood and gives some
    binary parameter distributions. We use their data for the solar $q$ value distribution in our
    modelling.

- ### Sollima+2007 - The fraction of binary systems in the core of 13 low-density Galactic globular clusters

    This one looks at binaries in low-density (young) clusters, generally finds much higher binary
    fractions, supporting the idea that high-density cluster loose many binaries from dynamical
    interactions. The numbers from this one probably aren't too useful for our clusters but nice to
    have for full overview of clusters.

- ### Milone+2012 - The ACS survey of Galactic globular clusters: XII. Photometric binaries along the main sequence

    Really nice discussion of photometric binaries, long and in depth with nice figures. It also gives more support to assuming a flat $q$ distribution in old, dense clusters.

## Modelling

- ### Ivanova+2005 - The evolution of binary fractions in globular clusters

    Monte Carlo modelling of GCs with `FewBody` handling the binary interactions. Finds that present
    day binary fractions should be very low, upper bound of $5-10\%$. Goes over how binaries are
    ionized in GCs through dynamical interactions and also stellar evolution. Also gives some
    estimates for WDs which could be useful in the future.

- ### Sollima+2008 - The evolution of the binary population in globular clusters: A full analytical computation

    Presents an analytic model for binary evolution in clusters. Goes through all the possible
    interactions and how they're modelled. Supports low binary fractions in dense clusters and also
    looks at the radial distribution of binaries in clusters. Has a nice blurb about why equal-mass
    binaries are more common.
